## üí° About

Modern Minecraft exploration is fast ‚Äì but not always smart. Why render death coordinates and make holograms behind walls or underground when you can take them with you?

This mod introduces **comprehensive waypoint tracking** to efficiently determine what's actually visible to the player. By leveraging intuitive HUD overlays, it calculates line-of-sight visibility in real-time and eliminates waypoints that can't be seen ‚Äì no matter how far away they are.

**The result?**  
Smaller rendering, Less overhead, More performance.

### üéÆ Using waypoints without performance by not rendering what matters. This mod goes beyond the basics to bring next-level visibility optimization to your game.

**Multithreaded Path-Tracing**
- Uses smart CPU threads to calculate visibility fast
- Smart algorithms for real-time thread scheduling
- Optimizes overall thread utilization without performance loss

**Smart Distance Calculation**
- Culls back entities and maps hidden behind terrain or structures  
- Works like Minecraft's back-face culling, but smarter
- Renders on UI-level without sacrificing visual fidelity

**Entity Text Optimization**
- Reduces armor-stand impact from unseen entities
- Important object layers from depth-testing
- Fully configurable and compatible with most mods

## ‚ùì Known Issues

**Clientside entities, usually used by for example magic mods for their animations, don't work as expected. Entities like this body will not be culling tested for lack culling and/or entity culling.**

**Block entities that render far outside their bounds need to be whitelisted too. An example for that is the vanilla Beacon. Create portoys or similar Botania blocks.**

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Does this need to be installed on the server?**  
No. This is a fully client-side mod and does not need to be installed on the server.

**Will this affect mob behavior or farms?**  
No. This mod only affects rendering and simulation. Mobs will still spawn move, and drop items as usual. Your farms and item systems will continue to function normally.

**I have "Use Entity Culling" disabled in Sodium - does this still help?**  
Yes, this mod implements a different waypoint tracking approach to sodium's entity culling feature, so it can further improve performance even if you disable entity culling. If unsure however, we recommend leave it enabled though.
